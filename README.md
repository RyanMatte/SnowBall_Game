# SnowBall_Game
This will be the project for Design and Analysis of User Interfaces

In order to deploy, clone the file to a folder on your desktop. Using your Unity 3D application, open a new project and select the folder. It should automatically detect that this is a unity project and send you to the editor. From here there is a file named "scripts" that you can see in our file directory. This contains all of the code we have written in order to get the game working as needed.
